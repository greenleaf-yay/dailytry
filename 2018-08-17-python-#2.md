```python
a = 1
b = 2
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
    print("a is definitely less than b")
print("Not suer if a is less than b")
```

    a is less than b
    a is definitely less than b
    Not suer if a is less than b



```python
# c = 3
c = 5
d = 4
if c < d:
    print("e is less than d")
else:
    print("c is NOT less than d")
    print("I don't think c is less than d")
print("outside the if block")
```

    c is NOT less than d
    I don't think c is less than d
    outside the if block



```python
# e = 8
# e = 10
# e = 20
e = 7
f = 8
if e < f:
    print("e is less than f")
elif e == f:
    print("e is equal to f")
    # print("e is greater than f by more than 10")
else:
    print("e is greater than f")
```

    e is less than f



```python
# g = 8
# g = 9
g = 7
h = 8
if g < h:
    print("g is less than h")
else:
    if g == h:
        print("g is equal to h")
    else:
        print("g is greater than h")
```

    g is less than h



```python
name = "YK"
height_m = 2
weight_kg = 90

bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
print("bmi: ")
print(bmi)
if bmi < 25:
    print(name)
    print("is not overweight")
else:
    print(name)
    print("is overweight")
```

    bmi: 
    22.5
    YK
    is not overweight
